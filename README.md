# Membership_Tracker
Simple and portable membership tracking app for small businesses.

Just set up a postgresql database with the tables shown in create_tables.txt.

Usage:
```
cd Membership_Tracker/
python3 main.py
```

Starting the app for the first time will go through an Admin user setup where you will create the first admin user with a username and password.
